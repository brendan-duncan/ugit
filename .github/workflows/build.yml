          ## Installation

          ### macOS
          If macOS shows a security warning saying "ugit is damaged and can't be opened", run this command:
          ```bash
          xattr -cr /Applications/ugit.app
          ```
          The application isn't being properly signed currently, so this is required to bypass Gatekeeper's checks.
        # GitHub token, automatically provided to the action
        # (No need to define this secret in the repo settings)

        # If the commit is tagged with a version (e.g. "v1.0.0"),
        # release the app after building
        release: ${{ startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v') }}
